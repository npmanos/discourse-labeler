# validate-reusable-workflows.sh - Verify reusable workflow refs in release
# workflows actually resolve at their pinned SHA/ref.
#
# Motivation: When an upstream meta-package consolidates or removes a reusable
# workflow (e.g., `slsa-provenance.yml` gets merged into `release.yml`), the
# downstream caller silently keeps pointing at a file that no longer exists at
# the pinned ref. GitHub surfaces this only when a tag is pushed and the
# Release workflow tries to resolve the `uses:` reference — at which point the
# tag name may already be committed to main and the release is blocked.
#
# This script parses every `uses: <owner>/<repo>/.github/workflows/<file>.yml@<ref>`
# reference in `.github/workflows/release*.yml` and does a HEAD request against
# the raw.githubusercontent.com URL for that file at that ref. A 404 indicates
# the reusable workflow no longer exists at the pinned ref.
#
# Exits:
#   0 - all references resolve
#   1 - one or more references returned 404 (or another non-2xx)
#   2 - missing curl / other environment error
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/validate-reusable-workflows.sh
#
# The script only scans `.github/workflows/release*.yml` by default. Override
# with the WORKFLOW_GLOB env var.
