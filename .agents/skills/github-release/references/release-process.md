# Release Process

## Overview

The complete flow from "create a release" to "release published on GitHub."

## Why `gh release create` Is Forbidden

`gh release create` does the following harmful things:

1. **Creates a lightweight tag** if the tag doesn't exist — lightweight tags have no signature, no author metadata, and cannot be retroactively converted to annotated tags.
2. **Burns the tag name permanently** — since GitHub immutable releases (GA Oct 2025), once a release uses a tag name, that name can never be reused. Not even `gh release delete` followed by `git push --delete origin vX.Y.Z` recovers it. GitHub returns: `"tag_name was used by an immutable release"`.
3. **Bypasses CI** — no provenance attestation, no SBOM, no artifact signing. The release is created directly with whatever you attach manually.
4. **Skips version file bumps** — source code still shows the old version.

The hooks in this repository block `gh release create` and `gh release delete` to prevent these outcomes. `gh release edit` is allowed only for `--notes`/`--notes-file` flags (release description overhaul).

## The Correct Release Flow

### Phase 1: Preparation

```
1. Detect ecosystem (see ecosystem-detection.md)
2. Determine next version number:
   - From conventional commits (feat → minor, fix → patch, BREAKING CHANGE → major)
   - From explicit user input ("bump to 2.0.0")
3. Create release branch:
   git checkout -b release/vX.Y.Z
4. Bump all version files for the detected ecosystem
5. Update CHANGELOG.md with new section
6. Commit: "chore: prepare release vX.Y.Z"
7. Push branch and open PR
```

### Phase 2: Review and Merge

```
1. PR passes CI checks (lint, test, build)
2. Reviewer approves version bumps and changelog
3. PR is merged to main (squash or merge commit per project convention)
```

### Phase 3: Tag Creation

After the PR is merged into main:

```
1. git checkout main && git pull          # advance to main's post-merge HEAD
2. git tag -s vX.Y.Z -m "vX.Y.Z"          # tags main's HEAD
3. git push origin vX.Y.Z                 # release orchestrator picks it up
```

The tag MUST be:
- **Annotated** (`-a` or `-s`), never lightweight
- **Signed** (`-s` for GPG/SSH signing) — required for SLSA L1+
- **On `main`'s HEAD after the PR merges** — not on the `release/vX.Y.Z` branch tip, not on an older commit

**Why `main`'s post-merge HEAD and not the release branch tip:** depending on the project's merge strategy, `main`'s HEAD after merge is one of:

- The original branch-tip commit, if the PR was fast-forwarded;
- A new squash commit, if the PR was squash-merged;
- A new merge commit, if the PR was merge-committed.

The tag must point to whatever is now the tip of `main` — that is what consumers will check out, what CI will build artifacts from, and what shows up as "the release commit" on the GitHub release page. With squash- or merge-commit strategies, the `release/vX.Y.Z` branch tip is *not* on `main`'s first-parent history, so tagging it produces a tag that doesn't correspond to any commit on `main`.

In practice: do NOT `git tag` from inside the worktree on the `release/vX.Y.Z` branch. Switch to `main`, pull, then tag — the steps above already enforce this order.

### Phase 4: CI Release Workflow

The tag push triggers the release workflow (e.g., `.github/workflows/release.yml`):

```
1. CI validates version tag matches version files
2. CI builds artifacts (binaries, archives, etc.)
3. CI generates checksums (SHA256SUMS.txt)
4. CI generates SBOM if configured (SPDX or CycloneDX)
5. CI creates provenance attestation if configured (SLSA)
6. CI publishes the GitHub Release with all artifacts and auto-generated release notes
```

### Phase 5: Release Description Overhaul

After CI publishes the release, the agent overhauls the auto-generated description into a narrative format:

```
1. Wait for CI release workflow to complete successfully
2. Review the commits included in the release (git log prev_tag..new_tag)
3. Write a narrative release description covering:
   - What changed and why it matters
   - Context for skipped versions or notable decisions
   - Grouped by theme (features, fixes, infrastructure), not by commit
4. Update via: gh release edit vX.Y.Z --notes "..."
```

The auto-generated notes (PR titles, contributor lists) are a starting point, not the final product. The agent's description should read like a changelog entry written for humans.

#### Narrative over implementation details

Release notes are for the people deciding whether to upgrade — users, admins, integrators — not for developers reading the diff. Lead with the user-facing story, then brief feature sections.

**Don't list:**

- Internal types, DTOs, enums, service-class names
- File paths or class paths touched by the release
- i18n unit counts or translation-bundle diffs
- Refactor details that don't change behavior

**Do describe:**

- What a user can now do that they couldn't before
- The configuration levels / option values a feature exposes
- Breaking-change surfaces with migration notes

**Bad example (diff-focused):**

> - `EnforcementLevel` enum, `EnforcementStatus` DTO, `EnforcementService`, `AdoptionStatsService`
> - 47 new i18n units in `locallang_db.xlf`
> - Refactored `UserController::indexAction` into 3 helper methods

**Good example (user-focused):**

> Per-group passkey enforcement with four levels: Off, Encourage, Required, Enforced. Admins can now configure whether a group's members may log in with passwords, are nudged toward passkeys, must enroll at least one, or must use one for every sign-in.

#### `--latest=false` for non-default-branch releases

**GitHub marks the most recently *created* release as "Latest" — by timestamp, not by SemVer.**

Creating a backport release (say v11.0.17) AFTER a newer release on a higher branch (v13.5.0) steals the "Latest" badge from v13.5.0, and users who click "Latest release" then get the old major.

**Rule:** this guidance does **not** override the policy above. On repositories guarded by this skill's hooks (including every Netresearch repo with a release workflow), manual `gh release create` stays blocked — CI creates releases from signed tags, not the agent. The rest of this subsection applies only to the rare unguarded case: repos WITHOUT a release workflow, where manual `gh release create` is the only path. In that case, pass `--latest=false` for non-default-branch releases:

```bash
# Backport release on TYPO3_11 branch while main is on v13
gh release create v11.0.17 \
  --latest=false \
  --title "v11.0.17" \
  --notes "Backport: CVE-2026-XXXX fix"
```

Default-branch (highest-version) releases keep the Latest badge; backports publish without stealing it.

**For the CI-driven flow (the common case)** — the release workflow, not the agent, creates the release, so the analogous setting is `make_latest: false` on the `softprops/action-gh-release` step (or the equivalent on whatever action publishes the release). Release workflows typically trigger on tag push (`on.push.tags`), so `github.ref_name` holds the tag (e.g. `v1.2.3`), **not** a branch name — branch-name comparisons will never match on that trigger. Drive `make_latest` from an explicit source of truth instead:

```yaml
# Combined trigger: tag push (normal case) + workflow_dispatch with explicit
# tag + make_latest inputs (for manual backport publishes).
on:
  push:
    tags: ['v*']
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      tag:
        description: 'Tag to publish (must already exist)'
        required: true
      make_latest:
        type: boolean
        default: true

jobs:
  publish:
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@...  # pinned SHA
        with:
          # CRITICAL on workflow_dispatch: ref_name is the branch the dispatch
          # was launched from (e.g. 'main'), not the tag. Without this, the job
          # builds assets from the wrong commit and publishes them to the tag.
          # On push.tags the expression below resolves to ref_name (the tag)
          # which is equivalent to the default checkout.
          # Use github.event.inputs.* (not inputs.*) so the expression stays
          # safe on push.tags runs — github.event.inputs resolves to an empty
          # string on non-dispatch events, while inputs.* is only defined
          # under workflow_dispatch / workflow_call.
          ref: ${{ github.event.inputs.tag || github.ref_name }}
          fetch-tags: true
      # ... build assets here ...
      - uses: softprops/action-gh-release@...  # pinned SHA
        with:
          # push.tags: ref_name IS the tag; workflow_dispatch: use the input.
          tag_name: ${{ github.event.inputs.tag || github.ref_name }}
          # Default to Latest on tag push; honor the boolean input on dispatch.
          # GitHub Actions expressions have no ternary — this is the idiomatic
          # and/or chain. fromJSON() parses the 'true'/'false' string from
          # github.event.inputs into an actual boolean for the `&&` short-circuit.
          make_latest: ${{ github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch' && (fromJSON(github.event.inputs.make_latest || 'true') && 'true' || 'false') || 'true' }}
```

For dispatch-only publishes (no tag-push trigger), drop the `push:` block; the combined expressions above still work, and you can simplify if you like. For tag-push-only workflows, drop the `workflow_dispatch:` block and always use `github.ref_name` with a fixed `make_latest` — but note that the fixed approach can't express "backport, don't steal Latest" without the dispatch input.

For repos using the shared release workflow template at `skills/github-release/templates/release-generic.yml`, file a patch there to expose a `make_latest` input (keep the name underscored to match GitHub's own action parameter; hyphenated names would force bracket-expression access, which is easy to get wrong) rather than forking per-repo.

## When CI Fails

If the release workflow fails:

1. **Workflow failed mid-run**: Re-run the workflow. If a release already exists, the workflow should handle idempotent creation.
2. **Artifacts are wrong**: Fix the issue and re-run the workflow.
3. **Startup failure**: Check that the caller workflow grants all permissions required by the reusable workflow (e.g., `contents: write`, `pull-requests: write`).

## Version Tag Format

- Always use `v` prefix: `v1.0.0`, `v2.3.1`
- Follow SemVer 2.0.0: `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
- Pre-releases: `v1.0.0-rc.1`, `v2.0.0-beta.3`
- No build metadata in tags (build metadata is not sortable)
